Despite the measures we take to optimise our security, it is nevertheless possible that something will slip through the net.\n\nShould you discover a security problem, we have a system in place for you to report it to us in a responsible way. We are happy to have your help to improve our systems and protect our customers even better.\n\nImportant!\nAlways operate within legal boundaries when identifying potential security issues. Do not demonstrate security vulnerabilities by performing DDoS attacks, brute force password guessing, social engineering activities, infecting systems with malware, scanning our systems, etc. Such actions will be considered and dealt with as targeted attacks, because they can cause harm to both Telenet and its customers. In such cases, Telenet cannot guarantee that you will not be prosecuted, since there is a risk that the authorities will take the necessary measures in response to such attacks.",
