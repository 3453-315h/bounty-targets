  "description": "At intigriti, we practice what we preach. We’ve built the platform with the greatest care and attention for security, but all software contains bugs and we are not exception to this rule. We encourage you to responsibly disclose any security vulnerabilities they may encounter and will reward you accordingly. \n\nIf you would like to report a software bug without a security impact, please report to letstalk@intigriti.com instead.\n\nPlease use the test project for all your tests. Refrain from creating test against our customer's projects.\nhttps://www.intigriti.com/public/project/intigriti/dummy",

Scanners also won't improve your skills, and can cause a high server load (we'd like to put our time in thanking researchers rather than blocking their IP's :-))\n- Please do NOT discuss bugs before they are fixed. You can send us a video as proof of concept, but remember to change its privacy settings to private\n\n#### Reporting Guidelines\n\n- Provide detailed but to-the point reproduction steps\n- Include a clear attack scenario. How will this affect us exactly?\n- Remember: quality over quantity!\n\n#### Researcher Safe Harbor\nWe will not pursue civil action or initiate a complaint to law enforcement for accidental, good faith violations of this policy. We consider activities conducted consistent with this policy to constitute “authorized” conduct under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. To the extent your activities are inconsistent with certain restrictions in our (intigriti) General Terms and Conditions, we waive those restrictions for the limited purpose of permitting security research under this policy. We will not file complaint against you for circumventing the technological measures we have used to protect the applications in scope.\n\nIf legal action is initiated by a third party against you and you have complied with our bug bounty policy, intigriti will take steps to make it known that your actions were conducted in compliance with this policy"
